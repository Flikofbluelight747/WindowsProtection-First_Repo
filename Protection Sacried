  "Protection is Sacried! Please help everyone. I claim no personal ownership. This is for everyone and anyone to add to...if they have good intentions obviously. I detailed what I felt was needed i.e. A amazing sandbox that auto checks for any sort of malware,spyware,tracking,tracing, or logging of your activities and removes these if possibe and if it cannot do so stops you from downloading it. 2. Allowing the best proxies to run on windows. A anti-virus/malware/realtime protection shield/behavior blocker/web surfing protection...like the current best security programs out today that does not interfer with VPN services. 3. A VPN service with the strongest protection. No DNS Leakage possible. Kill switch if disconnect from VPN and rotating locations. 3. Keyboard scrambler/encrypter. I type (b) b is entered but, is seen as (%) by systems internal and external. Meaning no Key logging probably needs to be more sophisticated. 4. Finally, and most importanly all this for FREE !  Why? Because Protection IS Sacried. As I believe this with all my heart and soul I am willing to do whatever I can to protect people like me, people like you, just people. I was taught and believe love conquers all. I find joy in helping other's. I ask all of you here and everywhere, we can do this, with love and sacrife! What's in it for you? Joy! Love! Hope!"
