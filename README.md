# WindowsProtection-First_Repo
I would like this, my first repository, to be about Windows Protection. Meaning adding an unparrelled Sandbox program that is completely secure. Adding Encryption to keyboards for Laptops and Desktops. Having the ability to poxy everything in the strongest proxies and to be user friendly :) Lofty Goal but, who doesn't like challenges aye?
